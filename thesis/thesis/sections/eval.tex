\section{Evaluation}

The system has been tested on two stories: `The Frog Prince' and
`Caliph Stork'. The story synopses of these stories were taken from Wikipedia
and annotated so they conformed to the model used in this thesis (using states
and actions).
These stories were chosen since they both contain animal transformations. In `The
Frog Prince' the titular prince starts as a frog and eventually becomes a human
prince, in `Caliph Stork' the caliph and his vizier start as humans, are changed
into storks with a magic powder and both have to find a way to get back to human
form. Since the stories have these common elements, the program has to be able to
handle these appropriately (see them as being two instances of the same type of
event).

One of the problems was that the transformations were slightly different. In
Caliph Stork, the transformation was done with a magic powder, and if the user
laughed while in animal form, they could not change back. This is explicitly
told to the caliph, and by extension, to the reader. However, in the frog prince
there are also certain prerequisites for the frog to become a prince again, but
these are never explicitly stated (did the frog have to be kissed by a princess,
or would any person, male or female, do?).

Since the magical transformation component in `The Frog Prince' was not explicitly
mentioned in-story, there was also no explicit annotation. However, in `Caliph
Stork', the rules of the magic powder were nodes themselves, all connected to
the magic powder. Because of this, the program learned that both explicitly
mentioning the rules was an option (and since only `Caliph Stork' had such
rules, the magic powder and its specific rules were the only type it learned), as well as not mentioning the rules
at all (as in `The Frog Prince'). However, the act of transformation was the
same, so the two instances were extracted as two parts of the same rule. This proves that the
program can learn similarities between stories like this one, and, given more
stories, it could obtain more and more accurate information.
