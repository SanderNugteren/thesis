I would like to thank my supervisor, Frank Nack, for supervising this thesis,
giving many thoughtful remarks, especially on the subject of the digital
humanities and new media in particular.

Also I would like to thank Radboud Winkels, for agreeing to be my assessor
on very short notice.

I would also like to thank the people who worked alongside me in the robolab. You
supplied me with both thoughtful remarks on my approach, motivation to keep me
going and diversion when I needed it (and when I didn't).
