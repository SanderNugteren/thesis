A prince is cursed by a witch and imprisoned in an iron stove in the woods. A lost princess finds the stove and is surprised to find it talking to her, offering to help her find her way back home, provided she return to the woods with a knife to scrape a hole in the stove, thereby freeing the prince, and marry him.
Her father the King, not wanting to give up his only child to a stove in the woods, tries to send substitutes back to the woods including a miller's daughter and a swine-herd's daughter. Although very beautiful, the women betray their origins, and the princess herself reluctantly returns to the woods. When she scrapes with the knife to make a hole, she sees that the prince is very handsome. He wants to take her to his own country, but she wishes to first bid her father farewell. He agrees, but tells her to speak no more than three words. She fails this prohibition, and can not find the iron stove.
In the woods, she finds a cottage full of toads and frogs. They give her shelter for the night, tell her how to find the princeâby climbing a high glass mountain, and crossing three piercing swords and a great lakeâand give her giftsâthree large needles, a plough-wheel, and three nuts. She uses the needles to climb the glass mountain and rolls over the swords on the plough-wheel. She finds a castle where the prince was getting married, and cracks the nuts. Each one holds a dress, and she barters each one for a night in the prince's room. The first two nights, his bride gives him a sleeping drink, but the third night, the servants have told the prince of her pleas, and he does not drink.
They steal the bride's clothing so she could not get up and flee, using the ploughwheel and the needles to get back to the cottage of toads and frogs, but when they arrive, it becomes a castle, and the frogs and toads, which were the children of kings, are all transformed back into their true forms. They live there for many years, until they are reconciled with the prince's father.
