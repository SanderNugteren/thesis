Pif-Paf-Poltrie asks Fair Katrinelje's father for leave to marry her. He is told he needs that of "her mother Milk-Cow, her brother High-Pride, her sister Cheese-Love," as well as her own. Going through the list, he obtains it, on the condition of all the others consenting. Fair Katrinelje is last; then she lists her dowry: some pennies, a debt, roots, pretzels, and dried pearsâa fine dowry. She guesses at his occupation, and he declares it is finer than what she guesses until she guesses broommaker.
