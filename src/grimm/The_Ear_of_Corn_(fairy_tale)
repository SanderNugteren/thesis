Corn (wheat) used to produce many more grains, but one day God saw a woman using the grain to clean off her muddy son. Angry, he cursed them to have no more grain, since they were not worthy of it. Bystanders pleaded with him to have mercy, especially because of the children, and he chose to have it have the current amount of grain.
