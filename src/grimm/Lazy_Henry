Henry was so lazy he minded his only task, driving a goat to pasture and back. He married Fat Trina so she would drive both his and her goats. Trina proposed trading the goats for a hive, which would not need tending. They gather a pitcher of honey and discuss whether to get a gosling. Trina wants a child to look after it; Henry says that children don't obey, any more than a servant does. Trina goes to hit him with a stick and breaks the pitcher. They agree that this way they do not have to look after the goose.
