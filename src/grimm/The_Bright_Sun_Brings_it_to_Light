A tailor's apprentice robs and murders a Jew on the road, despite the Jew saying that "The bright sun will bring it to light." He then settled down. One day, he saw the sunlight reflecting from his coffee and jeered about its bringing "it" to light. His wife bothered him until he told her what he meant. She gossiped about it, and he was arrested and executed.
