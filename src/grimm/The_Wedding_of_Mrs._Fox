In one variant, Mr. Fox feigns death to test his wife's fidelity. In the other, he actually dies. Many suitors arrive. Mrs. Fox rejects them: in the first variant because while they are foxes they do not have the nine tails of her husband, and in the second, because they are wolves, bears, etc. and do not look like her dead husband.
One suitor arrives who does resemble him and a wedding is held. If Mr. Fox feigned death, he arises and drives them all out.
