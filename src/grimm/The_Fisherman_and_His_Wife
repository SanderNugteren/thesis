There once was a poor fisherman who lived with his wife, Ilsebill, in a hovel by the sea. One day the fisherman catches a golden flounder, which claims to be an enchanted prince. The fisherman kindly releases it. When his wife hears the story, she says he ought to have had the flounder grant him a wish. Ilsebill tells him to go back and ask the flounder to grant her wish for a nice house.
The fisherman returns to the shore but is uneasy when he finds that the sea seems to becoming turbid, as it was so clear before. He makes up a rhyme to summon the flounder, and it grants the wife's wish. The fisherman is pleased with his new wealth, but the wife gets greedy, then gets on a slippery slope of outrageous demands. When she sees the mansion contains a considerable amount of land, the wife says there is enough property to become king of all this land, and suggests the fisherman wish himself a king. The fisherman has no desire to rule, but she says she will rule, first as queen, then empress and finally pope. Each wish granted shows her increasing ostentatiousness: the mansion is transformed into a castle, and the wife's throne becomes progressively grander. The fisherman knows this is wrong but there is no reasoning with his wife. He says they should not annoy the flounder and they need to be content, but his wife yells down his arguments. The fisherman realizes he cannot reason with his wife. The flounder grants the wishes, but the sea grows increasingly stormy every time the fisherman goes to summon the fish. Although the fisherman has no problem resting in his sybartic surroundings, the wife's rapacious greed cannot let her rest. She wants an office that outranks pope.
Eventually, the wife goes too far when she wishes to command the sun, moon and heavens and become equal to God. The flounder revokes everything it granted, the seas are again clear and calm, and the fisherman and his wife are returned to their hovel.
